Exercise 2:
Interacts with the APIs
at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
and gets info about users'
to-do lists and which tasks have they completed.

This file then writes the USER_ID's string
form and all the user's tasks in a dictionary
into a file called f"{USER_ID}.json".
The task dictionary itself is the task's title,
named 'task'; weather or not the user completed
the task, titled 'completed'; and the USERNAME,
titled 'username'.

Go to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/
and https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
to understand how the JSON data is recieved by this program.
